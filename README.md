##

SigNoz helps developers monitor applications and troubleshoot problems in their deployed applications. SigNoz uses distributed tracing to gain visibility into your software stack.

üëâ You can see metrics like p99 latency, error rates for your services, external API calls and individual end points.

üëâ You can find the root cause of the problem by going to the exact traces which are causing the problem and see detailed flamegraphs of individual request traces.

### üëá Features:

- Application overview metrics like RPS, 50th/90th/99th Percentile latencies, and Error Rate
- Slowest endpoints in your application
- See exact request trace to figure out issues in downstream services, slow DB queries, call to 3rd party services like payment gateways, etc
- Filter traces by service name, operation, latency, error, tags/annotations.
- Aggregate metrics on filtered traces. Eg, you can get error rate and 99th percentile latency of `customer_type: gold` or `deployment_version: v2` or `external_call: paypal`
- Unified UI for metrics and traces. No need to switch from Prometheus to Jaeger to debug issues.

### ü§ì Why SigNoz?

Being developers, we found it annoying to rely on closed source SaaS vendors for every small feature we wanted. Closed source vendors often surprise you with huge month end bills without any transparency.

We wanted to make a self-hosted & open source version of tools like DataDog, NewRelic for companies that have privacy and security concerns about having customer data going to third party services.

Being open source also gives you complete control of your configuration, sampling, uptimes. You can also build modules over SigNoz to extend business specific capabilities

### üëäüèª Languages supported:

We support [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) as the library which you can use to instrument your applications. So any framework and language supported by OpenTelemetry is also supported by SigNoz. Some of the main supported languages are:

- Java
- Python
- NodeJS
- Go

You can find the complete list of languages here - https://opentelemetry.io/docs/

# Getting Started

## Deploy using docker-compose

We have a tiny-cluster setup and a standard setup to deploy using docker-compose.
Follow the steps listed at https://signoz.io/docs/deployment/docker/.
The troubleshooting instructions at https://signoz.io/docs/deployment/docker/#troubleshooting may be helpful

## Deploy in Kubernetes using Helm

Below steps will install the SigNoz in `platform` namespace inside your k8s cluster.

```console
git clone https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz.git && cd signoz
helm dependency update deploy/kubernetes/platform
kubectl create ns platform
helm -n platform install signoz deploy/kubernetes/platform
kubectl -n platform apply -Rf deploy/kubernetes/jobs
kubectl -n platform apply -f deploy/kubernetes/otel-collector
```

\*_You can choose a different namespace too. In that case, you need to point your applications to correct address to send traces. In our sample application just change the `JAEGER_ENDPOINT` environment variable in `sample-apps/hotrod/deployment.yaml`_

### Test HotROD application with SigNoz

```console
kubectl create ns sample-application
kubectl -n sample-application apply -Rf sample-apps/hotrod/
```

### How to generate load

`kubectl -n sample-application run strzal --image=djbingham/curl --restart='OnFailure' -i --tty --rm --command -- curl -X POST -F 'locust_count=6' -F 'hatch_rate=2' http://locust-master:8089/swarm`

### See UI

`kubectl -n platform port-forward svc/signoz-frontend 3000:3000`

### How to stop load

`kubectl -n sample-application run strzal --image=djbingham/curl --restart='OnFailure' -i --tty --rm --command -- curl http://locust-master:8089/stop`
